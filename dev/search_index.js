One of them, the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT; Tandon et al. (2017,2020)) carries two gratings in the FUV channel and a single grating in the NUV channel. These gratings are useful for low resolution, slitless spectroscopy in the far and near UV bands of a variety of cosmic sources such as hot stars, interacting binaries, active galactic nuclei, etc. The calibration of the gratings are described in Dewangan (2021). This package includes tools for the UVIT grating spectroscopy based on updated calibration following the method described in Dewangan (2021).

The UVITTools.jl package provides functions for each of the steps in generating the calibrated spectra (i. e., f_lambda Vs lambda) as well as a single tool to generate the final calibrated spectra. The package also provides functions to generate source and background PHA spectral files and the associated instrument response file (response matrix + effective area) for each of the gratings. These PHA spectral data can directly be used in X-ray spectral fitting packages such as XSPEC and SHERPA.  The grating PHA spectral data are treated in the same as the X-ray spectral data, and are useful for simultaneous UV/X-ray spectral modelling.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Extraction-of-1d-count-spectra","page":"Home","title":"Extraction of 1d count spectra","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The CCDLAB pipeline has the option of generating images from the grating observations either in the detector coordinates left unrotated or rotated to align the dispersion axis with the X-axis.

If multiple photon events fall within 3times 3 pixels in a frame, then these photon events can be detected individually but recorded as arising due to a single photon. Such saturation of photon events cannot be avoided unless the photon rate per frame is much less than 1. Tandon et al. (2017,2020) have devised an algorithm to correct for the saturation.  This algorithm is implemented in the UVITTools.jl function uvit_saturation_corr, which is called by the aperture photometry task uvit_aphot if the option for saturation correction is provided. The algorithm for the saturation correction is applicable to point sources only, and users need to use a circular extraction region of radius about 12 arcsec (see Tandon et al. 2020 for details).","category":"page"},{"location":"#XSPEC/Sherpa-compatible-single-channel-spectral-data-and-responses","page":"Home","title":"XSPEC/Sherpa compatible single channel spectral data and responses","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The UVITTools.jl package also includes function to extract single channel PHA spectral data from FUV/NUV images in any of the broadband filters.
